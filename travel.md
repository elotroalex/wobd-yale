# Travel to New Haven

Travel to New Haven can be tricky. Below are some of the most common ways to get here, along with some tips and tricks.

## Flying

If you’re coming from outside the Northeast, flying is the best option. There are three major airports that service New Haven:

1. **Bradley International Airport (BDL)**: Located in Hartford, about 45 minutes from New Haven. It’s the closest major airport and has a good number of flights. If you come to Bradly, you can take a taxi or a shared ride service like Uber or Lyft to get to New Haven. The ride will cost around $50-$70.
2. **Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR)**: Located in Newark, New Jersey, about 1.5 hours from New Haven. It has a larger number of flights and is often cheaper than Bradley. If you come to Newark, you can take an Amtrak train from the airport to New Haven. The train ride takes about 2.5 hours and costs around $30-$40.
3. **John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK)**: Located in New York City, about 2 hours from New Haven. It has the most flights, but it’s also the farthest away. If you come to JFK, you can take the AirTrain to Jamaica Station, then transfer to the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) to Grand Central in Manhattan. From there, you can take a Metro North train to New Haven. The total travel time is about 3 hours and costs around $40–$50.
